# Laboratory 2.8: Decision Tree Methods

## Description

In this laboratory practice, you will implement and evaluate various decision tree-based methods for both regression and classification tasks. You will work on the following tasks:

0. **Setup**:
   - Clone the repository and install the required packages.
   - Load the Hitters.csv and Carseat.csv datasets.

1. **Regression Trees**:
   - Implement regression trees with different complexity parameters.
   - Visualize decision boundaries and tree structures.
   - Analyze the effect of tree depth on model performance.
   - Evaluate regression performance using RMSE.

2. **Classification Trees**:
   - Convert regression problems to classification problems.
   - Implement decision tree classifiers with appropriate parameters.
   - Visualize the decision tree structure.
   - Evaluate classification accuracy using confusion matrices.

3. **Ensemble Methods**:
   - Implement Bagging with decision trees.
   - Implement Random Forest classifiers.
   - Implement Gradient Boosting methods.
   - Compare ensemble methods with individual decision trees.
   - Analyze feature importance across different tree-based methods.
